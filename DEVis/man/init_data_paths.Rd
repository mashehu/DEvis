\usage{
init_data_paths(count_path, target_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_path}{Path to directory containing count data. Count data is assumed to be tab-delimited text
represent raw expression counts for each gene, with samples indicated by column and genes identified by row.
Column names in count data must correspond to row names in target files.}

\item{target_path}{Path to directory containing target data. Target data can be tab-delimited or comma-seperated text.
Target rownames must correspond to count column names.  Additionally, any data can be included in target files to
